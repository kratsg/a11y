_This is an email similar to what I (as a Deaf professional) would send if I were looking for ASL interpreters. This would be especially true in an unfamiliar city if a friend/colleague had given me names/emails to reach out to. The email text is first, and then a brief breakdown follows._

# Email text 

Hello! **[COLLEAGUE'S NAME]** said you might be a good fit for me; I'm looking for ASL interpreters in the **[CITY NAME]** area.

I am a **[d/Deaf/HoH, however you identify]** **[PROFESSION (chemistry professor, lawyer, anthropology PhD student, CEO, whatever)]** at **[YOUR INSTITUTION'S NAME]**. I am in **[CITY NAME]** for **[REASON (a conference, graduate school, client visit, job interview, etc.)]** and am looking for ASL interpreters for **[DATES, TIMES, LOCATIONS]**.

**Describe the steps you have taken so far to find interpreters:**
* Have you asked the host institution to look (what have they said?)
* Have contacted other local interpreters, if you know any?
* Have you tried to find agencies?
...but I haven't had any luck, so I'm stuck **[COPING MECHANISM (speechreading? writing back and forth? cancelling the interview?)]** unless we can figure out another solution... any help you can provide would be much appreciated!

**Describe the job as much as you can:**
* What is the setting? What will it look like -- lecture hall, circular seating, coffeeshop, private office, etc.?
* Who will be present? (Names, roles, DHH/hearing status and your best guess on language choices if applicable, prior relationship with you if applicable, etc.)
* What are your goals? (get the job, present 2 papers and network with these four specific colleagues, get the facts on my client's legal case, give the patient a second opinion on their diagnosis, etc.)
* What kind of dynamic do you expect? (Lecture, one-on-one interview, panel, press interview, conference call, meet-and-greet, etc.)
* What kind of vocabulary/language will be used? (Legal, medical, technical, social science, academic, lots of in-jokes, large range of international presenters, other signers will be present, etc.)

**Describe how you'd like to interact with interpreters in this situation as much as you can:**
* Will you be signing? Speaking? Going back and forth between the two? Something else entirely?
* Receptively speaking, do you prefer Signed English with mouthing, PSE/contact sign, ASL, academic ASL, etc.?
* Are you new-ish to working with interpreters? Would you like them to give suggestions on what you might do? Or are you experienced and know exactly what you want?

I know this isn't everything, but I would be happy to answer any other questions. Thanks in advance, and please feel free to contact me at **[EMAIL]** or via SMS at **[PHONE NUMBER]** or at **[OTHER PREFERRED CONTACT MECHANISMS GO HERE (FaceTime? Glide? Carrier pigeon?)]** with any questions you might have!

**[YOUR NAME]**

# Email breakdown

* Networks are everything, interpreters love it when someone thinks well of their work, so saying "my colleague said you were good" is a great compliment (and if your colleague has given you their contact information, they've done so for a reason!)
* starting off with "I'm a DHH person!" also immediately grabs their attention; you're not some random clueless agency they get a million emails from every day
* "I'm a DHH professional, and you can help me do that!" is also a big deal. DHH professionals are rare; you're changing that by virtue of just existing (I know, I know, hopefully this won't be so special later... but right now, we are on the front lines). The chance to push DHH professional work forward is pretty exciting.
* There's the usual "I have done my homework" section that shows you know your stuff; if your host institution / school / event / company /whatever is being clueless, make a note of that so they can help.
* And then there's some of the same information you would send for a general interpreting prep email. First, this establishes that you know how to do that and they'll be able to get more information about the situation so they can do a good job. Second, this helps them figure out if they are qualified and/or know someone else who might be.

_Good luck! This situation can be tough, especially if you're doing it for the first time. I know that when I first started out, I thought I was this mainstreamed/oral kid who had totally missed out out on some kind of Magical Deaf Person Knowledge that everyone else knew. Nope... we pick it up by doing it, asking questions, and making mistakes along the way. I hope this document helps other people.
