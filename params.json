{"name":"a11y","tagline":"How to accommodate the Mel.","body":"# Event (conference, symposium, etc) accessibility request\r\n\r\nHello -- you're probably at this page because I'm attending your event, and I'm deaf and will require accessibility accommodations. Here's what I'll need:\r\n\r\n## Written documentation\r\n\r\nSchedules/notes/documentation/papers in written form whenever they are available.\r\n\r\n## CART (realtime transcription)\r\n\r\nIn-person CART (realtime trancription) for keynotes/plenaries. If in-person CART is not available, remote CART with a [projected screen](http://stenoknight.com/demo.html#cartprojected) is doable. I recommend contacting [Mirabai Knight](http://stenoknight.com/), [White Coat Captioning](http://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com/), and [ACS Captions](http://www.acscaptions.com/), who can explain their services and rates and help you figure out the best setup for your event. As a side benefit, other attendees with hearing loss, ADHD, dyslexia, auditory processing disorder, and English-language learners will benefit -- and you'll have transcripts of the keynotes/plenaries immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n## ASL (American Sign Language) interpretation\r\n\r\nAn ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or interpreting team for the duration of the conference, including evening networking events. I would suggest contacting your disability resource center (or the nearest such center at a local university) to find a good interpreting team that can handle the complex content of the event.\r\n\r\n## Questions?\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, I would be happy to connect you with a counselor at my university's Disability Resource Center. They are familiar with my needs as well as the typical setups for events like yours, and can point you towards additional service providers if needed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
