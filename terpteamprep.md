# Hi! Here’s stuff that might be useful for you to know from Mel: #

* I grew up oral. One-on-one, I speechread well. Brief interactions, I may be fine alone. If it’s longer, please interpret. A good rule of thumb is to proactively slide in behind the speaker and begin interpreting. Thanks!
* I voice for myself 99.999% of the time.
* During presentations with minimal audience interaction and visual aids, I’m comfortable following the powerpoint without interpreting until the speaker starts spontaneous expression again. I may look away to take notes; if I do, please hold and chunk the points I miss. (If I’m doing that for an extended period of time, feel free to just keep going.)
* I’m accustomed to academic ASL with mouthing of key vocabulary. When I’m interacting, I appreciate seeing the English. If you aren’t familiar with the jargon, mouth the word and guess at the phonetic spelling, and we’ll have a high chance of getting the right word.
* To give you an idea of my discipline: I have a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a PhD (in progress) in Engineering Education. My current job is as a postdoctoral fellow doing organizational development. Technical, educational, and social science terminology come up often in my work.
* I’m an extrovert. Please let me know if you’re getting tired, and we’ll take breaks.
* When meetings are informal, please introduce yourself to everyone, because I’ll forget.

# Directions: #
* Continue down Olin Way (hug the left side when there are turn offs.) You will arrive at campus. It's pretty tiny, only three buildings. Parking is to the left; there should be a visitor's spot free in the rows closest to the buildings.
* Milas Hall, 1 Olin Way, Needham, MA

# Faculty Meetings: #
* Please meet Mel or Brittany in the lobby of Milas Hall, near the library. 
* Typically 50-75 people in a large room, one presenter at a time with powerpoint. One hour of fairly fast-paced presenting on the main activities in which faculty are involved. The next hour (less if the meeting ran over) is lunch. The faculty will serve themselves from the food provided, and you are welcome to lunch as well. Mel will join a conversation, so you’ll be interpreting table talk for a bit. 
* Mel works for part of Olin they refer to as "the Collaboratory" (we’ve been signing it as “united” with mouthing) or "Aspirations." It conducts outreach and research with other institutions. She attends the faculty meeting with the goal of knowing what's in development so that she can share it with external stakeholders and network among the other faculty. 
* NAME-OF-PROVOST is the Provost and Dean of Faculty and Engineering. He often chairs these meetings. It would be appropriate to ask Mel to introduce you.
* Typically, the interpreters sit on the opposite side of the screen of the presenters at the front of the room.

# Vocabulary: #

There are various abbreviations used, and they are not always predictable. Here are a few that Mel is closely involved with:

* Insper- a partner institution in Brazil. Olin has sponsored their engineering program.
* UTEP (“You-tepp”) - a college in El Paso, Texas, that Olin has been working with through their outreach program, the Collaboratory.
* Ahmedabad University - a college in India that is sending faculty on an exchange to Olin. We abbreviate this as “AU.”
* Argosy Foundation - the foundation that sponsors many of Olin’s outreach activities and partnerships with other institutions (including the Collaboratory.)
* Several course name abbreviations that MIGHT come up: UOCD (a second-year design class, short for “User Oriented Collaborative Design”) and MatSci (materials science). Also, three degrees are offered here: MechE (Mechanical Engineering,) ECE (electrical and computer engineering) and engineering (with many concentrations under that umbrella.)

# Invoicing #
* If you haven’t worked for Olin before, please send NAME-OF-HR-PERSON your W-9.
* Please email final invoice to NAME-OF-HR-PERSON and NAME-OF-FINANCE-PERSON and CC Brittany. (emails are listed here)
* If you send a hard copy instead, please address it to: NAME-OF-HR-PERSON, 1 Olin Way, Needham, MA 02492

Thanks for working with us! If you think of other information that would be helpful on this document, please let Brittany know.
